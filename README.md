# Inverted Index Search Engine

we have a large data base of documents which is DOCUMENT.txt file and in order to quickly search words in the data base we use the inverted index algorithm, so in the bottom of the zaxire_final.py file we call the main_dictionary() and write_start_unmergefile() functions, afterward running this functions you can comment them and search your favaorite documents.\n 
in order to find the appropriate documents you can search some words, finally we show some correlate documents, which we show you with easygui, with the several lines which introduce the document and you can select your favorite document and see all the content of it.
