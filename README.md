# Inverted Index Search Engine

we have a large data base of documents which is DOCUMENT.txt file and in order to quickly search words in the data base we use the inverted index algorithm, so in the bottom of the zaxire_final.py file we call the main_dictionary() and write_start_unmergefile() functions.
afterward in order to find the appropriate documents you can search some words, finally we show some correlate documents with the several lines which introduce the document and you can select your favorite document and see all the content of it.
